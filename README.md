*********** ATTENTION ***********

  this program can be used to circumvent censorship.
  doing so can be VERY DANGEROUS in certain countries.

  ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT PROXYCHAINS WORKS AS EXPECTED
  BEFORE USING IT FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS.

  this involves both the program and the proxy that you're going to
  use.

  for example, you can connect to some "what is my ip" service
  like ifconfig.me to make sure that it's not using your real ip.

  ONLY USE PROXYCHAINS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

  THE AUTHORS AND MAINTAINERS OF PROXYCHAINS DO NOT TAKE ANY
  RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY ABUSE OR MISUSE OF THIS SOFTWARE AND
  THE RESULTING CONSEQUENCES.
